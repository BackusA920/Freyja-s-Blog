<h1>Welcome to Freyja's Blog Page</h1>
<p>Welcome to Freyja’s Blog, a lovingly crafted, single-page HTML site that shares the adventures of Freyja, a spunky, cuddly, one-year-old Mini Australian Shepherd. This blog captures her journey from her very first day home to her first birthday, complete with adorable stories, cute photo galleries, and lots of tail-wagging moments.</p>

<p>Created as a personal and creative project, this site combines beginner-friendly HTML structure with semantic tags, accessibility-friendly elements, and a fun, pun-filled personality. It's a celebration of love between a dog and her human, built with code and heart. 🐶💻</p>
