        <h2>The Tail Behind the Tale</h2>
        <p>Hey there! My name is Freyja and I just turned 1 year old. I’m a Mini Australian Shepherd full of fun, spunk, and lots of cuddles. I’m not the biggest fan of other dogs, but I usually warm up to people once I get to know them. I love going on walks with my mom and my human brothers. Bones are my favorite treats, and cuddling with my mom is probably my absolute favorite thing in the whole world. 🐾</p>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my blog, I hope you enjoy following along with my adventures!</p>

          <h3>My First Day Home</h3>
          <p>My first day at my new home was really scary. Everything around me was unfamiliar, strange people, weird smells, and things I’d never seen before. I was so nervous I could barely move. Every little sound made me jump, and I just didn’t know what was going on. My mom kept trying to play with me, but I didn’t understand what she was doing. I didn’t even want any food or treats because my tummy was upset from the car ride. That metal thing was so loud and fast, I’d never gone that fast before in my life! After a while, my mom stopped trying to make me do anything and just let me be. That night, she brought me into her bed. I didn’t move, I just laid there staring at her, trying to figure everything out. She slowly fell asleep while petting me, and for the first time that day, I felt safe. I curled up next to her and finally drifted off to sleep too.</p>
          <p>That first night was really rough for me. Everything was so new and overwhelming. I didn’t move a single inch, I stayed right next to my mom all night long. I felt safest being close to her. When she woke up in the morning, she was so happy to see me. I got tons of pets and cuddles, and then she let me outside and gave me some food. I wasn’t too sure about the outside though... there was white stuff all over the ground and it was cold on my feet. Brrr! ❄️ I was still really scared, but it was my first full day with my new family, and I was slowly starting to get used to everything.</p>

          <h3>My First Week</h3>
          <p>I’ve officially made it through my very first week in my new home with my new family! They really love me, I get so many pets, playtime, and lots of new snacks to try (yum!). I’m still a little scared of a lot of things, but I definitely feel safest when I’m with my mom. She’s my favorite person, and I like to stick close to her whenever I can. Guess what? I learned my very first trick! When my mom says “sit” and I put my butt down, she gives me treats! I think I’m starting to get the hang of this. I could definitely get used to this whole treat-for-being-cute thing. 🐾</p>
          <p>I’ve had a few accidents in the house... oops. It made my mom a little upset, but she still gave me love and treats. I’m really trying to get better at going potty outside, it’s just hard because I’m used to going wherever I want. I wasn’t a tiny puppy when my mom got me, so I was already used to using pads or going in my pen. It’s a bit confusing trying to learn what she wants me to do, but I think I’ve been doing a pretty good job! She tells me I’m a good girl more and more now, so I must be getting something right! Oh, and I went in that weird fast metal thing again (they call it a car), and this time it took us somewhere really cool! It was so beautiful, and I got to run around and play with my human brothers. I had the best time! Maybe the car isn’t such a scary place after all.</p>

          <h3>My First bath</h3>
          <p>Okay, so something really weird happened today. My mom did this thing,and because I trust her, I tried to be super brave, but I was honestly really scared. There’s this big white, holey-looking thing in a room I’m not usually allowed in... and water comes out of it. Well... today, my mom put me in it. Yep. Right in there. It was warm and kind of relaxing, but also very scary. I got so nervous, I peed a little. 🙈 My mom just laughed gently and told me it was okay. I didn’t like the bath much, but I let her wash me and rub me because I knew I could get out sooner if I was good. When it was finally over, I smelled different — not bad, just... not like me. She wrapped me up in soft fabric and cuddled me for a while. That part I really liked. But then… she pulled out this loud, windy machine. I think she called it a “dryer.” I didn’t like that at all. She kept twirling it around me again and again. I was SO relieved when it was finally over! The good news? I got lots of treats afterward. And snuggles. I really love snuggles. 🛁🐾</p>

          <h3>My First Birthday</h3>
          <p>Today my mom was hootin’ and hollerin’ about something called a birthday. I’m not totally sure what that is, but let me tell you, if it means extra treats, attention, and belly rubs, I’m all for it! She kept saying things like, “Oh my gosh, I can’t believe you’re ONE year old!” and then she’d scoop me up for hugs and kisses. It was almost too much… but I love my mom, so I gave her kisses back to let her know I appreciate the love (and snacks). I’ve been with my family for three and a half months now, and wow, what a journey it’s been. I’ve learned so many new things, I’m not nearly as scared as I used to be, and I’m starting to feel really at home. Although… my mom still laughs at me because I’m still afraid of the kitchen. Hey, no one said bravery comes overnight!</p>
          <p>Okay… now my brothers are singing to me. What is this madness?! They all stood around and sang, “Happy birthday dear Freyja, happy birthday to you!” I tilted my head and stared at them like… what is going on? But honestly, I kinda loved it. My beautiful, weird little family makes me feel so special. Then came the best part,they gave me the most delicious snack I’ve ever had in my entire one year of life! If this is what a birthday means, I vote we do it every day. It’s been such a fun day, full of treats, cuddles, songs, and so much love. I can tell Mom’s getting sleepy now, and it’s almost time for bed. So…</p>
          <p>Happy Birthday to me, and goodnight, Mom. 🐾💖</p>

          <h3>Pawtraits of Perfection</h3>
          <p>My mom is constantly snapping pictures of me, she says I’m the cutest thing ever. Honestly? I’m just out here living my best life, but if she thinks I’m being adorable, I’ll roll with it (literally... I love rolling in the grass). So, without further ado… here are all of my mom’s wild and wonderful photos of me doing what I do best, being me. 🐾💁‍♀️</p>
